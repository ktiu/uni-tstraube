I am a Research Associate at the Department of Human Geography at Goethe University Frankfurt in the field of Economic Geography.

In my doctoral research project, I engaged with algorithms and security technologies.
Currently, I am chiefly interested in modeling, prediction and technological intervention practices concerning climate, weather and air quality.

With years of experience as a software engineer and project manager in the technology sector, I design theoretically-informed, hands-on learning experiences that introduce students to Geography’s quantitative methods in meaningful ways. My teaching underlines the importance of data literacy and critical approaches to digital technologies.

Within the organizing team of the upcoming [Deutscher Kongresses für Geographie](https://dkg2023.de) I am responsible for all technical aspects and the implementation of graphic design.
