I am a Research Associate at the Department of Human Geography at Goethe University Frankfurt. With years of experience as a software engineer and project manager in the technology sector, I design theoretically-informed, hands-on learning experiences that introduce students to Geographyâ€™s quantitative methods in meaningful ways. My teaching underlines the importance of data literacy and critical approaches to digital technologies.

My research interests center around critical data science, digital infrastructures and security technologies. My paper-based PhD project will come to a conclusion in early 2022.
